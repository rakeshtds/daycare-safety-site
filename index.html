            <h2>The Unseen Dangers: Vehicle-into-Building Incidents</h2>
            <p>While we focus on what happens inside, a significant and often preventable risk looms just outside. The tragic **Richmond Hill daycare crash** is a stark reminder of how vulnerable our children are to vehicle-into-building incidents.</p>

                <h3>Over 100 crashes a day</h3>
                <p>According to safety experts, vehicles crash into buildings in North America over **100 times every single day**, resulting in thousands of injuries and fatalities each year. These are not rare occurrences.</p>

                <h3>Children are at high risk</h3>
                <p>A significant percentage of these incidents happen at storefronts, offices, and, most alarmingly, at **schools and daycares**. The lives of our most vulnerable are put at risk during common activities like drop-off and pick-up.</p>

                <h3>Lives are on the line</h3>
                <p>Every year, hundreds of children are tragically killed or injured in vehicle-related incidents in Canada and the U.S. These are not just statistics; these are children whose futures are cut short by preventable accidents.</p>
