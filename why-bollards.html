                <h2>Responding to the Call for Safer Childcare in Ontario</h2>
                <p>Following the heartbreaking incident, the Province of Ontario has announced new proposals to make daycares safer. These include a ban on parking spaces directly next to classrooms, entryways, and playgrounds, and a commitment to remove barriers preventing the installation of protective structures. **Fixed bollards** are the most effective solution, providing a clear, physical barrier that meets the spirit and intent of these new **childcare safety reforms**.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Advantages of Fixed Bollards:</h3>
